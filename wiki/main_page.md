This wiki is intended as a place to host introductory material and tutorials about running molecular dynamics simulations, methods and protocols of the group, and other useful materials for performing computational research. If you are new to the group, please be sure to read the [UNIX commands for computational chemistry](Unix_commands.markdown) and the [Basics of a GROMACS simulation](2019-08-01-gromacs).

 A number of tutorials are provided to help new undergraduate research students in the group get training on particular methods and to get an idea of the nature of computational research in our lab.
